A simple project optimizing MP4 files for streaming by moving the 'moov' ATOM to the begining of the file

The project consists of one main simple file ( PatchMP4Moov.cpp ) where all of the logic is implemented, it is 
implemented on Windows OS though due to the code simplicity it should be easily imported to any other platform.

To run:<br /> 
1. Open the project in Visual Studio<br />
2. On the project properties set an input and output files.
3. Run the project.
